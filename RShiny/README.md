<h1> Forest Service Timber Harvest Shiny App </h1>

Within this folder are the r scripts and forest service data needed to launch a shiny app. The shiny app can be used as a tool to easier sort through the U.S. Forest Service timber harvest data for Idaho. One can sort by National Forest, project, or activity. The sorted data can be downloaded as a .csv file. Additionally, the app shows a scatter plot of the time lags (the difference between the planned and completed date for an activity) through time.
